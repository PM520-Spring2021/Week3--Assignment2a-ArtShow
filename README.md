This repo is for the part b of Assignment 2. You are asked to produce a picture usingFractals on the Complex plane (see slides for week 3 for more info).

You need to upload both your code and the picture you produced. (For this assignment, it is ok just to run the code I provided to you.)
Please try to make your picture look nice (i.e. no axis lines, preferaqbly in a nice frame), and please do give it a title that is as artily pretentious as you can manage.
